☆ do not interact:
- if you f--ked my mom /j
- discriminates against race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, etc
- **toxic tt/td/dnt people** that say things such as ”piss off” or ”go away”,
like stfu you arent special stop getting so defensive and toxic over a single pixel.
there's always better ways to word shit if you don't want them coming near you,
and maybe instead of being so rude to people who probably struggle a lot in their lives,
you just do a couple of clicks and hide them???
- believe racebending is okay either way, whether whitewashing or 'blackwashing' (its in marks for a reason sjws).
honestly their canon race is fine theres no need for you to change it wth
- if i'm a part of YOUR dni list. remember that dni goes both ways.
- idk what else i'll probably add more if i remember
